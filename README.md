a repo for building and documenting my a level h446 computer science NEA project

## TO-DO:
### frontend:
  - flashcard practice view
    - text box variation
    - self grade variation
    - audio buttons
  - stats view
    - link to stats backend

  - code for stats view calculations
  - code to turn daily available time into actionable intensity
  - code to allow for changes in intensity for 1 day/week etc
  - spaced repetition code
    - push data to stats view/permanent data storage 
  - points allocation/tracking
    - daily/weekly/long term goal completion rewards
